# DriftSense ðŸ“Š

Welcome to the **DriftSense** documentation!

The `DriftSense` package is designed to calculate the drift or stability of data distributions across datasets. This is a critical metric for evaluating changes in data distributions over time and ensuring the continued validity of AI/ML models.

## ðŸ”Ž Drift Types

- **Feature Drift** â€“ Measures changes in input feature/variable distributions over different time-periods or across different datasets
- **Target Drift** â€“ Monitors shifts in the target variable over different time-periods or across different datasets
- **Model Drift** â€“ Uses predicted score/ predicted labels to assess model behavior over different time-periods or across different datasets
