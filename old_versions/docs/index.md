# DriftSense 📊

Welcome to the **DriftSense** documentation!

The `DriftSense` package is designed to calculate the drift or stability of data distributions across datasets. This is a critical metric for evaluating changes in data distributions over time and ensuring the continued validity of AI/ML models.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This package enables:

- Binning of features using multiple strategies
<!-- Detection of data drift using CSI and PSI -->
- Evaluation of feature, target, and model stability
- Regulatory compliance support (e.g., SR11/7 in banking)

---

## 📦 Requirements

- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
