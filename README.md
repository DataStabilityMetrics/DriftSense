# DriftSense

Welcome to the **DriftSense** documentation!

The `DriftSense` package is designed to calculate the drift or stability of data distributions across datasets. This is a critical metric for evaluating changes in data distributions over time and ensuring the continued validity of AI/ML models.

---

## Overview

This package enables:

- Binning of features using multiple strategies
- Evaluation of feature, target, and model stability
- Regulatory compliance support (e.g., SR11/7 in banking)

---


## Features

- This library supports multiple binning strategies:
  - **Equal Width Binning** - Evenly spaced bins between the min and max of the data.
  - **Equal Frequency (Quantile) Binning** - Each bin contains roughly the same number of data points.
  - **Adaptive Binning** - Supervised binning using decision trees, requiring a target variable.
  - **K-Means Clustering** - Binning using clustering especially K-Means Clustering.
  - **Domain-defined bins** - User specified binnings for numeric or categorical.

- Handles missing values (`NaN`) safely
- Suitable for numeric and categorical variables
- Lightweight and dependency-friendly

---

## Requirements

To use this package, you’ll need the following dependencies installed:

- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `pytest` *(optional, for testing)*

---

## Installation Steps

### Option 1: Install via pip (recommended for stable version)

```bash
pip install DriftSense
```

---

### Option 2: Clone from GitHub and install locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datastabilitymetrics/DriftSense.git
cd DriftSense
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage Example

```python
from driftsense import get_bin_edges

# Example 1: Equal Width
bins = get_bin_edges([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], bins=2, method="equal_width")
print(bins)  
# [1. 3. 5.]

# Example 2: Adaptive binning with a target
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
target = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
bins = get_bin_edges(data, bins=2, method="adaptive", target=target)
print(bins)
```

## FAQ

Q: What happens if I pass NaNs to the function?

A: NaNs are automatically filtered for all methods except domain.

Q: Is this tool suitable for categorical variables?

A: Yes — use method="domain" and pass a list of category labels.

Q: Can I use this for live model monitoring?

A: Absolutely! It's designed for robust performance and interpretability.

Q: What’s the difference between equal_freq and equal_width?

A:
    - equal_width: Divides the range evenly.
    - equal_freq: Each bin contains roughly the same number of samples.
