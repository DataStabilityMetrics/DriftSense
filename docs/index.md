# DriftSense

Welcome to the **DriftSense** documentation!

The `DriftSense` package is designed to calculate the drift or stability of data distributions across datasets. This is a critical metric for evaluating changes in data distributions over time and ensuring the continued validity of AI/ML models.

---

## Overview

This package enables:

- Binning of features using multiple strategies
<!-- Detection of data drift using CSI and PSI -->
- Evaluation of feature, target, and model stability
- Regulatory compliance support (e.g., SR11/7 in banking)

---

## Requirements

- `Python 3.7+`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`

---

## Get Started

Quickly explore powerful tools to ensure **data stability**, detect and monitor **data drift**, **model drift** — all in one seamless package.
